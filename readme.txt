== Description ==

I can't find any six sigma calculator to add on my wordpress blog. So here is Cp and Pp calculator.


Process capability is fairly easy to calculate all you have do is enter:


*USL (Upper set limit), 
*LSL (lower set limit) 
*SD (Standard deviation) 


=> This plugin will calculate the 


*Cp
*Pp
*Process Sigma Level
*CpK (Coming soon)
*PpK (Coming soon)
