== Description ==

I can't find any six sigma calculator to add on my wordpress blog. So here is Cp and Pp calculator
Process capability is fairly easy to calculate all you have do is enter your USL (Upper set limit), LSL (lower set limit) and SD (Standard deviation) and This plugin will calculate the Cp,Pp and will tell you process sigma level.

I tried some examples and this plugin works well. I plan to add more functionality like CpK, PpK etc.. 

Let me know of your feedback :)
